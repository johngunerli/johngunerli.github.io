We humans love to use the word computing a lot. In many introductory courses, the concept or the word *computing* is described as the first matter to be disclosed. The famous video from the Human Computer Interaction Course at Georgia Techâ€™s online course pretty much defines everything as a computer that is capable of doing some sort of electronic device that does computation (arithmetic or logical, although you can perhaps argue that arithmetic calculations also are logical operations by nature).

Especially from a social perspective, we deal with computers every day and they become a part of our social lives. Now that this is the case, we must consider the societal implications and consequences of computing. Socially-aware computers, or machines that seamlessly interact with our society are vital for the creation of communities that can live on technologically advanced spaces.
