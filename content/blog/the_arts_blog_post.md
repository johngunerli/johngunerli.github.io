I oftentimes think about the arts. Now mind you, I’m not an artist by any means or not as educated in the arts as I would desire to be, but I think that’s what makes the arts unique compared to other matters. Yes, you *****might***** want to know the purpose of one’s music or one’s paintings to really admire the work, yet you need not any education on the matter to enjoy it. I think this puts the arts in a unique place compared to the sciences. 

As I am sketching this material, or trying to describe what the arts means to me, I am listening to 1920s ballroom music. These people are dead, most of their memories, their desires, and aspirations are long gone. Yet, one thing remains, that is, the arts. I was not raised in the Roaring 20s, I have no idea what the the ideation or the projections these people had in their lives as they were listening/composing these types of music, yet I feel the sway, the feelings they were able to engrave in their music, much like how they are engraved on the vinyl records.
