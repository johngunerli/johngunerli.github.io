# Intellectual Curiosity

I find intellectual curiosity to be a fascinating area of study. The mind serves both as a cage as well as a blank canvas or a garden. Just like a garden, it’s an area where you can roam around, take in the unique scents and characters within it. Just like a cage, however, it can feel very claustrophobic at times where you are stuck with an intellectually pondering problem that you cannot personally find the steps to start off with. 

I find myself in this area quite a lot. This isn’t a matter of pride, but at even times of crisis my mind works more than it should. Not necessarily always looking for intellectually pondering questions, but problems that require a sort of inquiry of the mind. Almost as if I self-cage myself with a thought, rather mostly unintentionally. In doing so, I make a problem that actually requires solving becomes a secondary task, even if it is a problem that requires a more critical response/approach.
